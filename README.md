# pyhmcode

This library provides a convenient interface to Alexander Mead's library, which underlies the HMCode and HMx codes to predict non-linear power spectra.
For details on the Fortran version, refer to https://github.com/alexander-mead/HMcode.

# Installation
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/alexander-mead/HMcode
```

```
pip install pyhmcode
```

# Alternative interface and CosmoSIS support
There is an alternative interface to compute powerspectra in the `powerspectrum_interface` subdirectory. 
This interface uses `ctypes` and a thin Fortran wrapper to access the main functionality of HMCode and HMx, namely predicting the non-linear power spectra.
Installation proceeds by 
```
cd powerspectrum_interface
pip install .
```
This installs the `pyhmx` python module, which in turn is interfaced with CosmoSIS using the `cosmosis_interface.py` module.
